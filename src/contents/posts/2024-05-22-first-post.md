So erm introducing myself would be so akward as my first blogpost and going straight uploading a rambles about something would also be very weird in my opinion. so instead I will use this opportunity to explain a little bit about how I came up with this website, though most of the backstories is already written in [About](../about) page but let me have this excuse.

Long story short I sometimes like to drop a long ass L undirected rambling on my social media about anything and it slowly turns to a habits nowadays, so I thought "why just not make a blog for it? I mean most likely nobody will reads it though!"  then I started to look for a way to make these kind of site. Yes definitely I have tried something like [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) and even the pro version of [Carrd](https://carrd.co/), but at the end of the day I never liked how those '*website-builder* thingy' work; they're clunky to operate and hard to style, yes you can always look for theme to inject for those websites but man I would rather have to go through hard time writing my own styles so I can have something simplistic and homey design to represent how bad I am at centering a div. Well, at some point last year I have ended up writing a post on [Medium](https://cinori.medium.com/) though because I feel it is the most simplistic one (sorry [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)), even tho 3 days later I said to myself "yep that was my last time writing on that site"

In response to that all clunky website builder is having a thought "why not write my own website? I mean a static blogsite wouldn't be too much hassle to write and it will be very light so I don't need a fancy vps or something to host." hence I begin to open my code editor and start writing this site from scratch.

Initially, I plan to build this website using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as it's something I am currently interested to know more and this will be a good opportunity to be more familiar with it, but then I realize if later I got stuck and it takes a while to solve I will definitely mald and stop writing because I'm a lazy ass person who's motivation dependent by those little sparks of idea. Because of that I ended up picking [Next](https://nextjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as those are the things I'm kinda more familiar and definitely can make sure that I will have this little project done pretty fast before I reached my limit and won't open my code editor for another month.

While I yap on these things I actually thinking about what topics I will talk next but honestly nothing is came up to my brain because this site is very basic.  

My aim is not becoming one of those zoomer fancy site who has multiple front-end animation that caused my 8 years old [*ZUK-Z2*](https://www.gsmarena.com/lenovo_zuk_z2-8125.php) to freeze, but something that checked all both *MVP* (Minimum Viable Product) features and fitting to my workflow. 

My first approach to the idea is because I usually write anything in notepad, it would be nice if I can somehow store the blogpost just like I store all my txt dump files in a folder. Sure I have my second brain on the cloud but I'd be more appreciate if it can be accessed locally using my laptop and it's something I have at local not something that in the cloud (ok before I get killed sure cloud is the meta for now that it guarantee more safe but deep inside me I'm a boomer who's not that comfortable to edit long ass stuff on the cloud). Then I remember I was used to app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a little back then to write some random experimental draft for my ramblings on my social media. I have lost most of my local vault due to reinstalling Windows (I mean most of the draft there was real bad that I'm not bother to backing it up lol) but it finally clicked with my brain and I thought "yeah that will work" because I know obsidian is a Markdown-based note editor; Markdown a is pretty common filetype to write something like application docs I mean even the weekly newsletter I subscribed are also written in Markdown. 

As all the puzzle pieces are gathered, now it's the time to start building. This looks very very simple and straightforward for those people who have *CS* background or even for someone who uses computer more than general people though. As this site is written using *TypeScript*, that supports [*EcmaScript6* (ES6)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) modules and syntaxes, we can access our local file by a very simple syntax called 'fs' (file system). The idea here to made a separate folder in the project to contain all my blog post that I have written beforehand in markdown using *Obsidian*, so I can just make the site as a simple system that will renders those *Markdown files* to the web. Now, because *HTML* can't render a Markdown properly (it will still be rendered but as plain text), I will use an *NPM package* called [*markdown-to-jsx*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx) to fully render it properly to my reactive HTML. Then how about the styling? good question because I have the same concern at the start, but thank god we're not living under the rocks. The *CSS* framework I use to style this web, [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), already have a plugin for Markdown [*typography*](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) so you can customize those rendered markdown file using it's plugin. Though I haven't dig deep enough yet to know whether it can be fully customized but I at the very least the option they have are enough at least for now, and for further customization I guess we will find out more later when I write more.

After all those *admin* shits just make some adjustment such as adding metadata to the markdown files, making static path with *slug* yada yada yada all those basic things and it's done. Whenever I need to edit or upload something I just need to open a Markdown-based note editor (I personally use Obsidian but even Notepad/NPP will do) and then just copy-paste it inside the repository folder where I store all my posts data, and finally rebuild the site to update it on internet. Very simple to setup, very easy to maintain and easy to modify if I want to add/edit more post or develop other stuff. This way the friction I have to write a post is way more less and will keep me motivated, a win-and-win solution.

That should wrap up the site and yes there are definitely other things I haven't mentioned yet but it's all honestly just the most basic thing about internet website like indexing, pagination and stuff. The design of this site is hugely inspired with those all god-knows whatever all eroge blog sites that I read back when I was very young, combined with my skill issue at web-styling in general.

Final thought is I'm pretty satisfied with this site because it's a perfect match with my lazy work-style since it's easy manipulated and developed while also should be loaded blazingly fast as a rendered static site. *Tbfh* I'm still not that used to write a markdown with all those syntax but well this might be the call for opportunity to write and learn more about it. There is more feature I definitely want to implement in the future like post-tagging and filtering but it's not that relevant not at least until I've made at least 15 post lol.

To wrap all things up (this time for real) I hope with this I will write more now that I have less friction and somekind *sense of responsibility* knowing that this has been uploaded to internet.

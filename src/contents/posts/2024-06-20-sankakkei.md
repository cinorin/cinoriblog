I've been taking interest to Kabocha-sensei art on [xwitter](https://x.com/kabo_cha0726) for a long time, and one day I saw a manga posted by him on his twitter, which looks interesting. Apparently it's their second manga, and I feel like I must take a look on it.

The manga itself is 三角形の壊し方, it's a yuri about three bestfriend-love-triangle, the angsty feelings I got from reading and overall vibe similarity made me remember with この恋を星に願わらない. Man, I may have a mental issues but triangle love yuri is the genre that I always adore for a long time, the angsty feelings you got from reading those shits is really addictive.

Their artstyle is something that I always look up whenever I saw Kabocha-sensei manga. Can't really describe it but its just something very unique to them, looks very personal and it has characteristic on every lines. I know it's not the best art you can find in manga, but it's more than decent.

It may have less narrative from my standard but I loved how the story is partially delivered from each prespective, and without too much bullshit like filler chapter etc, everything presented is relevant to the main story. The topic of this manga is something I think kinda crucial if the storytelling is fucked but it surprisingly flows really good and it can gathers the vibes while pulling the true feelings from its main characters to the outburst. 

### Story

The story is taking background on Tanabata festival, as the girls making love-triangle like 夏大三角形

There is three girls in drama-club, Koto, Aya, and Erika. Aya has been a top performer for their drama club and Erika always come second, Koto is the timid girl you see in every friendship media you have read. Despite the friend-rivalry with Aya, Erika has been liking Koto for the longest time, but she know that Aya is the only one in Koto eyes. Koto thinks, with Aya beside her she can move forward and well apparently indeed she did. Koto confessed to Aya before tanabata festival, and managed to steal a kiss in the school library. They finally going out after Aya has been hanging her answer for some time. They promised the to meet tomorrow at tanabata festival for their first date, but only Koto comes, and Aya never came to the festival. Later it's found out that Aya is gone missing.

7 Years later, after the school reunion, they meet Aya in the exact same form she has dissapeared last time. They just found out that all this time Aya has been spirited away. Well, what could be happen now that they three reunited again by fate? clueless emoji.

I don't usually like it when there's SF-thingy like time-traveling included but this one comes up surprisingly interesting; maybe because it is not the main menu here. Even after I finished to read up to the latest volume, I didn't really question about it because I realized the things happened here is more a supernatural thing and mostly it's referring to the old Tanabata origin story.

### 彦星 (Aya)

>Why it's just me, that behind on life?

>It has been seven years, what kind of life has you led?

>Regardless what happened in seven years, I still love Koto, so it's fine, right?

Equation of time is the same fair for all the livings. Time doesn't care, time doesn't have mercy, it just flows without ever stopping. 

And thanks to the time equation, Aya's is now living on a nightmare. Sure she knows that she's with the same Koto and Erika, but is that really the "same" Koto and Erika she always know from 7 years before? why is Koto and Erika are talking about the topics she did not even included with, is that really them I know? why Aya, who's technically always been ahead from them, always be with them up until yesterday did not even know about it ? "Why just within a second, I feel so left behind...."

Back then, Aya was playing hard to get to koto, refusing to give her a reply for her first confession. Aya is always bested erika in their club, getting all the leads and praise. But suddenly, the world turns back to her. Koto is now an adult who's not looking too fixated on her anymore, there maybe a feelings, but it's complicated, she didn't treat Aya the same anymore. It's same when she saw Erika, Aya thought she, who always bested her in stage but now Erika is the one who getting all the exposure, she's now a real actress, and on top of that she's taking a modeling job. How Aya's feeling knowing all of that? suddenly the world just turned back for her.

She tried so hard to feel okay and replicate the feelings to Koto, because as for her, it's just been 7 days after they decided to going out. But does Koto feel the same, after all this years? I can't imagine how scary it is to be Aya, she doesn't have anyone within a second, the girlfriend she know is now a different person, she feels out of place anywhere she is. Even if she tries to love Koto again so hard up to the point she doesn't care about herself, dont you think it really reaches koto?

### 織姫 (Koto)

>There's someone I'll ever forget, someone whose colors will never fade

Time is the most influential things in our life. You can't get more time in this world, even when you have gazilion tons of money; which most people think is the absolute currency of our life. Time equation can makes everything looks different. The same people, the same relationship, but why now it's different? You see, with just time added to the equation, everything is different. Even the love that supposed to be bloom. Everything changes within time, and if you don't change, you're the same as the dead. I remember hearing that somewhere. The spirited away thingy is beautiful approach on the topic.

For Koto, it looks like the equation of time brings her fullfilness of her truly loved one back. Happiness and the dream comes true go happy. But is that true? Aya was her nightmare at some point of her life. She tried every way possible to forget Aya, and now she's coming to her again, still having the same feelings towards Koto the same as 7 years ago before the tanabata date. Isn't that a nightmare or a loved one who's coming back?

Koto's character writing has lacked consciousness and just general concistency in her character, but maybe that's what makes her as a character interesting. She said one thing but doing the opposite thing that she just said, it's confusing, lack of concistency but needed for the plot. After Aya re-confessed to her, she's just go straight up fall even though she know fully that there is 7 years life difference between she and her.

>Seven years... is more than enough time for a person to change

>I'm sure the present me.. isn't having the same persona as the you agreed to date, Aya

Even when Aya is back and desperate to replicate her feelings to Koto, it's just that easy to say that when time equation is added to the calculation..

Maybe it's another emphasis of how scary love is. It's scary how people can be blinded - ignoring all things just for their sake of 'love'. What is love either? sometimes it made me thinking a lot. All I know, being in love is the same as standing on the top of a cliff. You can be sure that you want to be with this person now and 3 days later you hate them for life. 

### 天帝 (Erika)

>Supernatural power or whatever... the fact that Aya is here... and if it allows Koto to change... im fine with it

Said Erika, as she wishing that Aya come back.

Erika is wicked but also the most 優しい character in this manga. Everytime I see her, she just looks so sad, it's natural knowing what's she's been through all this time. She loved Koto so much that she's okay with not being with her. She surpressed her feelings all this time, even when Aya's gone. She needs to fill the role of bestfriend while Aya's gone and taking care of Koto even when she piled up her hidden feelings towards Koto in the same time. 

>I swear, she doesn't know how I feel at all

>I hope someday she'll know. but now isn't the right time

>I'm just, waiting for their relationship to fall apart

She understand herself and the situation too well, unlike those two friends of her. The hole inside Koto's heart is only can be filled by Aya, but even with that fact, Erika is still being Koto's best friend and taking care of them while Aya's gone. She knows really well even when Aya's gone, even she's taking advantage of Koto right now, she's just an actor in the end of the day. A stand in for Aya's until she come back. It must be so damn frustating when you know all of that too well but still being her side all of this time, the feeling Erika has to koto is definitely true love.

She is my favorite character in this manga, and she has important role as the father of Orihime, Tentei. Completing the love triangle of these girls. She always loved Koto, but she knows really well that in her eyes, there's only Aya. I really can't help myself but fall to every character that has this role on story troupe like this. The first time I read this, Erika made me immediately remember 水月 from 君望; really man, you just always needs this role to complete a triangle-timeskip love.

Despite how angry Tentei is, she loved her daughter. And so, Tentei let Orihime to meet Hikoboshi once a year on the 7th day of the 7th month.

Can't wait for the next Volume.

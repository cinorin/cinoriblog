Welcome to summer 2024. Honestly I don't really watch any anime PVs for this season and don't really see any hype other than Oshi no Ko S2 and Nokotan anime but we'll see how it goes. I plan to reduce my seasonal anime starting from this season and I do think it's a great idea considering there's not really much interesting shows happening this season.

<em>Rin Nanakura from Giji Harem eps 1</em></center>


## some solid watch


Roshidere 1-3 : Decent artstyle, amazing animation, and probably that's it. Characters are bland, story are just the other generic ass romcom with some slightly different background but even from episode 1 you can smell that this is ass in the long run. The imouto is probably the only reason I would continue watch this as she's probably the only interesting character on the list. I can imagine reading the novel I wouldn't even lasts 1 volume because how boring is this. But even since it's ass and boring, I wanna try to watch all 12 episode because dude I want to see the imouto more and since the visuals are great it doesn't bore me that fast. Alya is looking very cute in the anime, MC expression somewhat not that bland and sometimes being a little funny, Yuki is more down bad in the anime, and Masha… idk she's just got introduced. Tl;dr I will stick to this anime for a bit long until I get bored of it.


Giji Harem 1-3 : Hayamin. First impression I really don't like the artstyle it feels crap for anime but apparently it was intended to inerhit the artstyle from the original manga, fine. I haven't read the manga yet and my intention was prolly just try to watch some of it since I'm a devoted Hayamin fans but damn I ended up liking this anime A LOT. Really love how the story is very easy, it's just a compilation of hightlight where mc and Rin met and do stuff together. You really don't need to think about anything and just enjoy the moment. Even with that kind of delivery the story is still progressing so we checked a lot of passing marks there. And definitely more plus mark on me since it's Hayamin. Having a harem is every man's dream but imagine I need to take care to many girl at once it's not a good experiance and I will feel bad for everyone because it's like cheating but with this anime... we got all the good things from every world. 便利, 最高, 天才. Definitely will picked up the manga after the anime finished airing. Prolly the most perfect schizo anime of all time.


Monogatari Off & Monster Season 1-2 : You're still beautiful as the time I left you. Commenting about Monogatari is kinda useless because everyone already know what it is and people who watch this season are fully aware what they're signing in to since this is their last novel adaptation I heard (cmiiw). Shaft is still Shaft, signature animation, amazing delivery and defo the quality is still on top. I feel the animation is the best among all of the Monogatari series adaptation but that might just be me because I was watching those old Monogatari probably in a low spec pc with crap resolution back then anyway.


Na Nare Hana Nare 1-3 : Anima Yell S2 or whatever but episode 1 was a total crap even when I'm a devoted Yuri eater. I don't get what's the main target of this anime like what they tryna to do or idk it's just all over the place. Episode 2 and 3 is on the better side though still have horrible delivery but ermmm it's kinda shaping into a better way. Luckily this season don't have many decent anime so I probably will stick on watching this just because I want to watch more Yuri or CGDCT in general more. Let's hope it's not getting too bad so I can stick until the ending.


Nige Jouzu Wakagimi 1-2 : Great overall. I'm so interested with this anime from the PV and dang it has been living up to my expectation all this time. Loved the story background, MC is interesting enough, and I like that it's very easygoing while we're actually getting a bit of serious story right there. Comedic part are lovely, not my favorite but it's a great thing to have and the comedy aren't lame anyway. Animation is the aspect that ultimately exceeding my expectation, especially the direction on spicy action scenes, let CloverWorks cooking. Will watch until the end.


Ririsa 1-3 : Thank god we're finally getting a real otaku anime since Katsuragi Keima era. It's basically Kisekoi mk2 but a lot better and interesting. While Kisekoi relies on the intrinstic value of their heroine especially Marin, this anime have a good spread throughout of it. Heroine are insteresting but are not too exaggerated, so far the 2 heroine are pretty much in equal footing while MC is also being a great character. I really like how MC is described as huge otaku, and doing a real otaku things like trying so hard to deny 3D characters and stuff, it seems that before this anime there is'nt really "otaku anime mc" that can goes this far denying real girls. Usually once their heroine is naked in episode 1 or 2 they're just forgot what it takes to be an otaku. Mikarin's backstory is also the thing I really like from this anime, it's simple but somehow her backstory is very エロゲらしい and I completely sold on it. We're in for kino shit. Don't know much about the author but if turns out the author is a real otaku that plays a lot of eroge.... I will not surprised since this SHOULD be a eroge story.


Nokotan 1-3 : Let me be honest that I feel the manga is lot funnier than the anime imo. Not that I say the adaptation it's bad nope it's still really funny as hell but when we talk about comparion to the manga it's just not right there at least for the first 3 episodes. Would watch till the end definitely and probably that's it since this anime is very straightforward just pulling jokes like Asobi Asobase and stuff. I love the opening everyone included me getting the hype of it and I must admit that Nokotan's sales department must get a pay raise RIGHT NOW because they're too smart promoting the anime from the 1 hour dumb dance until the Deer's 計画, really appreciated that part. Funny to see people that apparently doesn't expect this to see be Yuri and immediately dropping after Anko's apperance. It was a really a good laugh seeing them trying so hard to deny that this is Yuri even making a fake news like on god brah just admit that you're watching Yuri NOW.


Tensui no Sakuna-hime 1-3 : Ah yes, Sakuna is getting adaptation. I bought the game not too long after the release date but I never managed to finished it lol, definitely finishing this game will be on my backlog after I watch the anime. Story is pretty much are the same without any different afaik but on the good side I think the adaptation is well made considering animation looking hella fine especially if you compare with other game adaptation like Ryza. Sure it doesnt have crazy shit keyframe or anything but its more than enough to classify this as a proper anime and not another 中途半端 game adaptation that is designed for promotion.


Vtuber Densetsu 1-2 : Amazing. This anime feels like the perfect budget and VTuber anime. It mostly only showing simple art and vtuber scene which can be replicated very easily and the most animation happening is somewat looking less-demanding but the direction of this anime is amazingly designed it can made you feel interested all the time and forgot that this anime is only using OBS shit ahh scene for straight 5 minutes. Same feeling just like when you're watching VTuber you are probably just see a fucking ass moving L2D and someone yap for 2 fucking hours, but it's fun and interesting all the time since I do that on weekly basis lmfao. Story is not that mindblowing like the direction since it's mostly just CGDCT stuff with some VTuber culture themes, but I really wish this is the anime we get when VTuber getting some boom at 2018-2019 era. Also beware that this is kinda heavy on the Yuri side so if that's not your jam then goodbye.

The Fable & Karasu wa Aruji Erabanai : Mostly still have the same impression from the last season, since both havent dropped yet.

## I can see dropping halfway

Dedede 1-8 : I like Oyasumi Punpun from Inio Asano. I havent read Dedede manga yet but I wanna see if it's any good or not from the anime. My first impression here looking from the animation, I feel that this is what I always wanted when Inio Asano's title getting an adaptation. Artstyle stays the same and the overall nuance is still very him. Though this time, I dont even know what he’s trying to do. I read Punpun and I really loved it, this time I feel like I’m reading something that wants to imitate things from Punpun. It wants to make a messy world and connects many characters but really, this time I cant see what he’s trying to say, unlike Punpun. I have watched this for like 7 episodes and shit still not getting anywhere kek. Finally on episode 8 I can see something is moving but damn if there's no real something in like 1-2 episodes this will go to drop. I coped so hard not dropping this in first 3 episodes since I really like Punpun but damn, this has need to stop. 


SHY S2 1-3 : I watched the first season and its quite decent but the second season is kinda boring somehow at least for these 3 episodes. Idk what we will do this season but nonetheless first 2 episodes are boring ass and kinda messy while episode 3 is finally being quite interesting and start shaping the story a bit. Will give it try for 1-2 more episodes.


Bye Bye, Earth 1-3 : Decent at best. Story is a little interesting for me but I feels like watching an adaptation from JRPG lol. Well for now I'm just kinda curious for what they want to do since the main topic is kinda grand imo so I can't help other than trying to watch until it flop or i got bored. Animation is pretty decent and I dont really have any big comments whatsoever.


Dungeon no Naka no Hito 1-2 : Dungeon this dungeon that. Though maintaining a whole dungeon is I assume pretty new on anime. New concept is appreciated and somehow for me it's quite interesting. Maybe only for a few introduction episodes. Will watch until it gets boring but nonetheless it doesn't really have anything to talk. My guess is it needs 4-5 episodes before it's just endlessly repeating the same unfunny formula for each episode.

## dropped


Gimai Seikatsu - eps 3 : Pointless. It has been 3 episodes but I don't see anything worth to spent every 24 minutes of my week for this anime. I do really want to see Saki more and listen to fhana every week tbh. As a slowburn enjoyers I appreciate that this anime is trying to be the slowburn SOL-romance stuff but damn, the characters are THAT bland and uninteresting story with weird delivery.


Megami Terrace Cafe S2 - eps 3 : What the fuck happened? I really like the first season though its no big different with gotoubun hanayome fwiw. Both story and renai progression are progressing very 順調 on season 1 just like another romcom stuff while mostly being enjoyable but how the fuck the writer pulled the most ass plot mover of all time on season 2????? this shit ain't worth watching my brother.

Atri - eps 1 : Well i've read the VN on day 1 release and it's straight ass VN. But as a VN appreciator I want to check out how VN nowadays adapted because god damn bro we're never getting real GOOD adaptation since i think ISLAND / YU-NO and it's always on the worse side like MLA adaptation and other bunch of stuff lol. Well great news the adaptation is pretty decent even the pacing is should be fine until the end in my opinion and definitely on the greater side compared to other VNs adaptation. ATRI lovers can yorokobe now.


Makeine - eps 1 : Animation is really really good. Sadly the mc is bland beta, characters are not that bland but somehow not that interesting. Story is not too-generic at start though after reading some spoilers it will be getting generic very soon lmfao. Also I can't stand with the girls uniform like what's wrong with that ribbon man. Though I must admit I like the bento joke, it's quite funny.


Nazeboku - eps 1 : Ya it's just another episode of "I thought it will be different but its not" plus the animation is ass. Should've stop attempting something like this and not trying to touch any titles that smells 転生 tbh.


Oshi no Ko S2 - eps 1 : I've read the manga and its horrible, though I admit Tokyo Blade is on the greater side of the story, plus I really like Akane and she getting hella highlight on this arc. Production is a lot better than the season 1 I believe, maybe since it's really popular now so they spent more budget on this. Prolly will watch all 12 episodes via skipping since I mostly only want to watch Akane scenes and the climax of Tokyo Blade drama. 


I Parry Everything - eps 3 : The main heroine is cute. Story is lesser than mid and it's just a repeated formula all the time. I can't see this being interesting in any time. Well unless you're braindead and just want that instant gratification from feeling superior than the other while acting like you don't know anything lmfao. 

Shinmai Ossan - eps 3 : Dude this is the same ass shit as the Parry anime I talk above GOD DAMN nowadays fantasy writer are either ass and write uninteresting shit or being the a big brain dude that makes amazing world building like Dunmeshi or Frieren


Katsute Mahou Shoujo - eps 1 : Don't have any problem its just not really my jam. Cute anime, simple romance is always good and appreciated.


Senpai wa Otokonoko - eps 1 : Already got the shota dose from Nige Jouzu plus this ain't 2015 where I still like reading femboys so no


Mob Kara Hajimaru - eps 1 : No


Koi wa Futago - eps 1 : I like love triangle drama in general but this time it's quite not working for me; everything are just too classic and mostly predictable generic. They tryna differenate with the backstory but it's not enough. Predictable stuff when you watch it until eps 6.


Soushimin Series - eps 2 : If you want to success you will not make another Facebook or Instagram, you'll make something new if you wanted to achieve success. A second time wouldnt work, that's just the ground rule. Hyouka works because its the very first of kind, second time wouldn't work.

## Anisong
Simply some of my current favorite anisong from this season :

1. キミ戦 2 ending ["Para Bellum" by Sizuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=529ff5Hvhcs)
- I don't watch the anime but damn this song is straight fire. First look on the ending and I got to see 2 girls dancing WHAT HAPPENED ON THE ANIME ACTUALLY??? Reminds me to classic fantasy anime song from 2010s era and slightly to Symphogear song somehow, which I REALLY LIKE.

2. Megami Terrace Cafe 2 ending ["Nacchatta! (なっちゃった！)" by Aglio Olio e Peperoncino (アーリオ・オーリオ・エ・ペペロンチーノ)](https://youtu.be/TRylsJokqoU?feature=shared)
- Best genki song from this season, really love the sudden upbeat on the chorus. Kawaii and never fails to make me smile and genki when listening to this. Classic vtuber signature.

3. Giji Harem ending ["Ad-lib (アドリブ)" by Rin Nanakura (CV: Saori Hayami)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib6xGN31BjE)
- Hayamin's signature. It's fairly just another standard Jpop but damn it's too catchy for my ears, really loved the bass throughout the song. Curious if someday someone will make a cover for this, should be damn good especially GFE Vtuber.

4. Nokotan opening ["Shikairo Days (シカ色デイズ)" by Shika-bu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxPcJTU-A8U)
- The funny song for this season, really catchy genki with some funy comedy happening on the lyric. And while we're at it I want to explain something I think funny from this song :
- So we have this line 'こころのどこかで虎視眈々' (kokoro no doko ka de koshitantan). See we're having 虎視眈々 (koshitantan) word which is a japanese 四字熟語 yojijukugo, a form of kotowaza ことわざ (japanese proverbs) tldr yojijukugo is an idiom that contained from 4 kanji (famous example : 色恋沙汰 irokoizata = love affair). And our koshitantan 虎視眈々 here has meaning as "Watching for an opportunity/prey" as like animal so in literal meaning 'こころのどこかで虎視眈々' is "somewhere in my heart, I'm watching vigilantly for opportunity" which is kinda funny because this line is sang by Koshi Anko, Torako's imouto who we all know that she's hella wild menhera.
- What's make this even funnier is when you look closely Koshi's family name it's written with the kanji 虎 (ko = tiger) 視 (si = viewing/inspecting) and afaik 'koshi' as 虎視 is not a common kanji name combination and the only time those two kanji met for a real word (or this case, idiom) is for the yojijukugo 虎視眈々 koshitantan I mention before. Now, in japan they call each other politely by their family name and our lead fmc 'Koshi Torako' is usually called at school by 'Koshi-tan' and with same kanji as the Koshi(tantan) so we can assume that the line 'こころのどこかで虎視眈々' can also be intepreted with "somewhere in my (Anko) heart, I'm waiting vigilantly (to strike opportunity on my sister)" *because of the same writing as koshi-tantan* 
- I don't know I'm just schizoing things but considered that I found that funny despite I don't know it's intended or not, literal meaning, and Anko's character trait, that line became very funny and also lovely at the same time. Also just in case; little common weeb knowledge 'tan' is used instead of 'chan' because japanese think it's cuter that way; child can't say 'chan' yet and when they try to say 'chan' the words that out from their mouth  is 'tan' so tan is more kawaii lol.
- Ok one more kanji joke from the show while we're still at it, not related to the lyrics but notice our MC Koshi name is 'Koshi Torako' written with kanji  虎 (ko = tiger) 視 (si = viewing/inspecting) 虎 (tora, using the exact same kanji as tiger(ko) from 'koshi' before but 'tora' reading is used to explain a drunkdard/alchoholic person) and 子 (ko, young women/child; pretty common girl kanji name) so yes now as you can guess 'Torako' with 虎子 kanji means "drunkdard young women" and what's our Koshitan occupation before being the seiso seitokaichou pafekto garu? yup, a yankee (deliquent) wich 100% can be aligned with the "drunkdard young women" name, AND if you want to precieve it as "tiger young women" is still fit her image because yankee/deliquent image is 'wild/beast' just like a tiger LOL. Also since it's a family name, Anko's also getting that name so yes anko is just as wild for her sister lmfao. Funny stuff. (Torako's hair is also yellow)

5. Mob Kara Hajimaru ending ["Strobe Fantasy (ストロボ・ファンタジー)" by May’n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfR71f9RgkA)
- This will be crazy good when full ver out, iconic May'n song with some touch.

Other songs that I kinda like : 
- Oshi no Ko S2 Opening ["Fatale (ファタール)" by GEMN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQiWHXSGN0)
- Gimai Seikatsu opening ["Tenshi-tachi no Uta (天使たちの歌)" by fhána](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBvAVGsZPNA)
- Wistoria ending ["Frozen (フローズン)" by TRUE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJJSdQldxtM)
- I Parry Everything opening ["AMBITION" by Maika Sakuragi [Utahime Dream]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxAhY6SKcMw)
- Dahlia opening ["Chiisana Tsubomi (ちいさな蕾)" by Nako Misaki (岬なこ)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La20U_Cyd6g)
- Katsute Mahou Shoujo oepning ["Mikansei Rendezvous (未完成ランデヴー)" by Lezel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8_0zwkOME)
- Giji Harem opening ["Blouse (ブラウス)" by Gohobi (ゴホウビ) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV6H7KyFcwY)
- Sakuna ending ["ORIGAMI" by Little Glee Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzNzav2SxLg)
- Sakuna opening ["Harebare!" by Ikimonogakari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh_YNq2jjqQ)
- [Na Nare Hana Nare opening is ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zbn7EBUcB8)
- [Makeine op also kinda ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXZcuHIR5ko)
- Bye Bye, Earth opening ["FACELESS" by ASCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRR2r4aW3lI) kinda ok
- Both opening and eding from Senpai Otokonoko is good and both from Kujira but I prefer the opening since it has more weird rhythms | [OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2uxFkb7znE)

And that's should be fine to wrap the first 3 weeks of this season. I'm thinking about adding Waifu of the season section but it's kinda pointless anyway. For this season it's undoubtly Akane Kurokawa, Rin Nanakura, and Yuki Suou. Maybe Mikarin as well, she's cute.

## write ups

**Girls Band Cry** - welcome to the new era where I will say "Girls Band Cry" and not my default "Shinsekai Yori" whenever someone ask me what's the best anime I've ever watch in general. Perfect composition, perfect animation, perfect pacing, even the music is argueably very good and I personally love it. Absolute cinema. Don't ask any question just watch it, if you don't like it then try again, jk. I still don't think anything can best this anime for perhaps some years later... 

**Dungeon Meshi** - If Girls Band Cry is a perfect anime for the weebs then Dungeon Meshi is the perfect anime for literally anyone. It's easy to follow, relatively slow pace at the start but it will heat up very soon and give you real interesting story with absolutely stunning world building. Their studio is Trigger so you just need to relax and eat while watching to make your food taste 2 times better. It's hard to say things about this anime without spoiling anything just like Girls Band Cry but the last thing I wanted to address that Senshi is my favorite character and all hail to Farcille nation. ED2 is absolute banger from Regal Lily which I never expect to see them for anime song but there it is, check out their other songs all of them are absolute bangers tbh. Can't wait for S2.

**Oi! Tonbo** -  Watching Tonbo is like watching my own child growing up. This show is full of different emotions and in the end you will ended up tangled in a magical bond to it characters with Tonbo's influence in every episodes. It has some weird episode order imo since the last 2 episode are quite mid compared to the build ups. I wished we talked about Bunpei x Yoko and everything in around episode 8-10 or around Tsubura appeared instead on the finale. It's still a quite fitting arc but damn I wished the finale was all about the golf and Tonbo herself after those crazy buildup from Tsubura arc man. Still a good show compared to most show in this season. Honestly why every golf anime I have seen are this good? I suppose we need more golf anime. Yes I'm looking at you, Sorairo Utility

**Astro Note** - Cinema. I wish this title gets more exposure and people watching it. This anime feels like an ultimate classic; storytelling, driving plot, even animation style. It's just sad that this anime doesn't sell good apparently and the studio had to apologize like what the fuck man, I'm quite surprised and shame to those zoomer having 0 sense of art. Anyway I learn so much things from this anime and it's making me have more composure in life. Great watch.

**Shuumatsu Train** - Actually have dropped this anime within first episodes because it kinda reminds me to Mahou Shoujo Magical Destroyers with some distorted futristic ahh vibes at start lol. My friend managed to convice me so I give it some chance and actually quite hooked on it. Was really a fun ride until the end and I absolutely love the decision to just 'accept who they are and how things be', defo a better show on this season.

**Konosuba 3** - I watch the Megumin anime and it's not that funny so I come to this with very low expectation. Thank god this anime turns out still funny just like the first 2, I feel coming back into 2017 with this one. Really man, This anime is the type that should keep doing the same stuff since season 1. I approve this anime is still funny and have the same original comedy that makes this anime so popular back then so there you have it. Another thing I want to mention and appreciate is how they're still having Machico to sing the opening, great watch.

**Dainanaouji** - God damn THE shota anime that kinda boom on my social media when it just got aired. I came for the memes just because how gyatt he is but damn this shit is funny and actually passable for a fucking tensai anime who I always hate. Still using generic OP ahh tensai'd MC that you know there is literal gazilion titles that use the same baseline but I guess the real difference is how this is delivered. MC managed being interesting and do funny things every episode so that's a good sign from tensai anime despite the allegations.

**Highspeed Etoile** - Finally a good racing anime that isn't from Initial familia. Love how this anime is very casual normie-friendly with all those AIs and very funny characters but still on the much richer way in terms of racing details. Defo if you're a geek on the topics it would be out of the standard one but in my opinion this is a great step in anime industry that tries to pick extraordinary topics as the main menu. Maybe someday anime can provide the details and perfect anime that those geeks wanted... 

**Madome** - Just another classic recycleable plot and other stuff but Nephy and For duo are TOO CUTE AND WHOLESOME I love them

**Blue Archive** - Battle animations seems great but SOL scene is somehow kinda off for me, I feel seeing some weird faces but not that bad and probably it's just me since no one on internet post it. Story is what you expect from a mobage and it's nothing special, this arc is also mid on the game so as everyone expected this anime is pretty mid. Hoping for more seasons so the peak Blue Archive story can be adapted to anime. Thanks for the Iori feet and Yuuka screentime.

**Henjin Salada** - Super mid. Erm I thought this will be interesting but turns out not. I don't like the male leads personality because it's boring and reminds me to Sasaki Pii chan last season. Sara and Livia is the plot mover for the first 3 episodes and all things they did seems interesting, but after 3 episodes, only Sara is developed and Livia wasn't. Sure Livia is an interesting innocent character but the joke she pulled is literally the same from the first episode. Sara is also not much different, maybe she has developed a little more up like I said until episode 6 but she's not getting any interesting either, the rest of the episodes is just showing Sara's crushing every ippanjin on her age, which I dont even find it interesting in any sense, maybe it's interesting for you, I don't know.

**Kaii Otome** - Storytelling is inconsistent, and it's just full of classic plot mixed with some japanese 伝説 thingy. This show is boring most of the time. MC doesn't have personality and probably Oto and 団地妻 solo carried this show, Terrible anime. I watch just because I want to see Oto's navel.

**Mushoten** - ~~nothing much to say just another boring as hell anime with some generic tear-grabbing scene that you already know 3 episodes before what will happened later. what makes me take a little interest in mushoten is because the neverending journey Rudy has offered but since they've come to the univ it's just got very bad and plain, and now you say that I need to watch Rudy and Sylphie playing house? give me a break. Second half of the show is kinda cooked though I must admit. Norn episode is really good, and the teleportation dungon thingy is somewhat interesting, even though the plot there is mostly generic and I just find it weird when Rudy is getting crazy ass scene everytime she mets the girl she liked but not this time when she finally reunited with Roxy, his first crush. But I guess nobody cares anyway, I don't care I just want to finish this anime and never watch it again unless I needs to lol~~ I write all of that before the episode his dad died so honestly just never spent your time to complete trash like this lol you'll rather watch kanokari instead this is the worst anime i've seen after nagiasu 10 years ago

**Yuru Camp 3** - It's sad to talk about this anime. I wish they should've copied Yama no Susume. This anime is lacked colors of it's character and at this point it's just used to be a CM to tourism sites in Japan, not that it's a bad thing it still makes me want traveling to Japan but damn this anime is boring as hell. I can make another post just talking about my assumptions about how Yuru Camp that has been undoubtly popular just flop this hard on this season but ya tl;dr it lacks ambitions and the colors of its characters are just pale. Try watching Yama no Susume and you will understand what I mean.

**Yorukura** - It's good, don't get me wrong. It's just not my jam. It may be yuri with good animation in some few first episodes but it's just not vibed to me. Though I admit it says really a lot about teenager and social media influence which I believe a very relevant topics nowadays. Sadly the problem-solving is just not there to keep up just like Seiyuu Uraomote. Most of the problem comes from a real relevant problem but the way how it get solved it's just very anime-ish nakama powa yeah it's not bad but not great either. Slightly more polished then how Seiyuu Radio handle things and no it's not that crazy good unless you're crazy with the yuri and let your imagination running too much. The yellow haired girl that didnt get any development until the very last episode and I kinda pissed off lol, can't believe I watched this until the end. Mid.

## Extra Entry

**Karasu wa Aruji** - It's not the greatest or nor the worst that i picked it. Honestly don't mind me because for me it's usual to pick the most average anime on the season just because I wanted to watch and enjoy it. And honestly I'm kinda a fan of imperial emperor japanse classic core background that uses keigo most of the time just because so yeah.

**The Fable** - Goes real hard, I love this anime. It's like watching some gamgster yakuza classics from 2005. Nothing much special else other than this anime is real hard. MC is funny and the FMC have very interesting personality, that's the 2 things that made the show not looking that pale despite using real classic generic yakuza gangster shit plot.

## Dropped Title (Episode):
- Seiyuu Radio (6) - Good premises but flop anime-ppoi countermeasure which is a big bummer (read my Yorukura review)
- Hibike Euphonium (1) - Not really hooked but I absolutely need to give them another chance after everyone buzz it after last eps lol
- Tonari no Youkai (2) - Not hooked and looks boring
- Sasakoi (4) - Flop production, read the manga instead
- Kaijuu 8 (6) - Complete flat boring ass anime, don't waste your time
- New Ookami to 香辛料 (1) - I've watch the OG one so I will skip until it gets to real new scenario later
- Unnamed Memory (1) - Engi & I don't like MC
- Jisan Baasan (1) - Not interested plus wasting time
- Tensei Kizoku Kantei Skill Whatever It Is (2) - Tensei anime is NG
- Hananoi Kun (1) - Unrealistic male protag
- The New Gate (1) - Generic
- Yozakura Family (2) - Generic & wasting time
- New One Room That Is Not 4 Minutes Anime (1) - Too old to watch sweets plus MC is shota
- Idolmaster Shiny Colors (1) - No

And probably that's it, see ya next season if I decided to still watch anime

Actually still not figuring out what to write in this section but on a certain day in my long years of unemployed life an idea just popped out from my head and it is to make a simple blog website for my usual undirected messy ramblings about every stuff I can think about because lately it has become a habit so here it is. Except some variety content here.

Usually I do these things on my social media account(s) but recently I've come to a regret that it's slowly disappear because I flood my own social media timeline as the system intended to be. Instead I will try to post it here so I can appreciate the permanity.

This website is fully developed / hand-coded by myself and not a fruit of wordpress or some-kind of website builder so you can't leave a comment here; but you can always get in touch with me and I always open for whatever things you wanna say for me.
